# twitter-widgets-ie8
~~Version of Twtter widgets script that works in IE8-
Basically, this will involve applying the fix from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28205278/twitter-widgets-js-throws-javascript-error-expected-identifier-on-ie8 to the publicly-available script from twitter.~~

The JS script in this repository was a stab at getting the twitter widget working in IE8.  I ended up giving up on this route and just styling the button based on screenshots from Chrome and a bit of JS to set up the link.
